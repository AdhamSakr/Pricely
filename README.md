# Pricely
This is a cross-platform mobile app written in React Native with the expo package. The aim of the app is to compare prices of products across different websites.
The app can search for a product using the product name or by taking a photo of the product, then the app returns a list of websites that sell the product. This list is sorted ascendingly by price. Previous searches are saved locally on the device.

## Used APIs
This app utilizes 2 APIs from Rapid API.
The first API is called "Real Time Product Search API" which is used to return a list of websites selling the searched product with their prices, image and a url for that website.
The second API is called "General Detection API" which is used to detect the name of the product in the photo captured by the mobile phone to be used as an alternate way of search.
